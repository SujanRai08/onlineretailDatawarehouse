# üü´ Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion (PostgreSQL)

This is the **Bronze Layer** of our data lake pipeline. It consists of raw ingested data loaded into PostgreSQL tables directly from CSV files, with minimal transformation and no business logic applied. This layer serves as the foundation for further processing into Silver and Gold layers.

## üìÇ Purpose of Bronze Layer

- Capture raw data exactly as it is received.
- Preserve data fidelity and audit trail.
- Allow reprocessing from source if needed.

---

## üß± Table Creation Scripts

The SQL scripts to create these tables are inside the `/bronze_sql/` directory.

Each CSV file is mapped 1:1 with a corresponding table:
- `customer` table
- `transactions` table
- `prod_cat_info` table

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Ingestion Notes

- Tools like `COPY` or `psql \copy` are used to bulk load the CSVs.
- Data types were chosen to match real-world values and support future transformations.
- Constraints are minimal to avoid ingestion failure from raw source inconsistencies.

---

## üîú Next Steps

Move to the **Silver Layer**:
- Apply joins
- Add relationships
- Clean the data
- Standardize types
